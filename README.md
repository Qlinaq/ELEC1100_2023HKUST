# ELEC1100_2023HKUST
This is the final project code for ELEC 1100 in 2023 semester, which is completed by 2 people (Lin and Wu) from Group 6.

The goal for full mark is to let the car finish running on a map in 20 seconds.

The map is shown below.

The whole program was run in Arduino. The most difficult part wasn��t the code, but the instability of the car’s battery and the appropriate distance between 2 sensors.
We had failed in the early demo although we have tested the car quite a few times. To avoid the changes of battery, we didn��t charge it, but it turned out ‘overcharged’ and the car left the white line.

The most ridiculous thing about the project is that we had debugged our code for nearly 5 hours, but mistakes appeared in different ways. However, it ran successfully after Wu angrily bended the sensors.

So this was totally “Xuan Xue”
