# ELEC1100_2023HKUST
# My Project
This is the final project code for ELEC 1100 in 2023 semester, which is completed by 2 people (Lin and Wu) from Group 6.

The goal for full mark is to let the car finish running on a map in 20 seconds.

The map is shown below.

The whole program was run in Arduino. The most difficult part wasn't the code, but the instability of the car’s battery and the appropriate distance between 2 sensors.
We had failed in the early demo although we have tested the car quite a few times. To avoid the changes of battery, we did not charge it, but it turned out ‘overcharged’ and the car left the white line.

The most ridiculous thing about the project is that we had debugged our code for nearly 5 hours, but mistakes appeared in different ways. However, it ran successfully after Wu angrily bended the sensors.

So this was totally “Xuan Xue”
