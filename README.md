# ELEC1100_2023HKUST
# My Project
This is the final project code for ELEC 1100 in the 2023 semester, completed by Lin and Wu from Group 6. The objective of the project was to enable the car to complete a map within 20 seconds.

The map, which is depicted below, served as the basis for the project。

The entire program was implemented using Arduino. While the coding aspect did pose some challenges, the main difficulties arose from the car's battery instability and determining the optimal distance between the two sensors.

During the initial demo, we encountered failure despite having tested the car multiple times. To prevent any changes to the battery, we decided not to charge it. 

Unfortunately, this decision led to the battery becoming "overcharged," causing the car to veer off the white line.

The most ridiculous aspect of the project was that, despite spending nearly 5 hours debugging the code, errors kept manifesting in different ways. However, we eventually achieved success when Wu angrily bent the sensors. It was an unexpected solution, but it worked!

I can only tell that this was totally “Xuan Xue”
